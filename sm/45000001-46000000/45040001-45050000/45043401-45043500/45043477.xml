Maybe one day... But the ending, you could say, was made according to this very concept.When I saw the previously mentioned animation by Onisigma, an idea came to mind of how it could be decorated and continued. True, since the animation was on a white shimmering background, it was not possible to adequately remove the white background and that's why the cut looks so rough. However, I made the video in the mood, for the sake of a joke, so it's okay :)</description><thumbnail_url>https://nicovideo.cdn.nimg.jp/thumbnails/45043477/45043477.42817317</thumbnail_url><first_retrieve>2025-06-01T14:19:03+09:00</first_retrieve><length>0:56</length><movie_type>mp4</movie_type><size_high>1</size_high><size_low>1</size_low><view_counter>8</view_counter><comment_num>0</comment_num><mylist_counter>0</mylist_counter><last_res_body/><watch_url>https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm45043477</watch_url><thumb_type>video</thumb_type><embeddable>1</embeddable><no_live_play>0</no_live_play><tags domain="jp"><tag lock="1">沙耶の唄</tag></tags><genre>ゲーム</genre><user_id>87675700</user_id><user_nickname>NOGREE</user_nickname><user_icon_url>https://secure-dcdn.cdn.nimg.jp/nicoaccount/usericon/8767/87675700.jpg?1736128749</user_icon_url></thumb></nicovideo_thumb_response>
