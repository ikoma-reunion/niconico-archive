There are a few songwriting gurus that I follow (YouTube or Instagram), whose wisdom is that the lyrics should convey a story, with development that leads the listener in, provides a connection. Sorry about this: mine tend to be deliberately vague and I like them that way. The listener has to use their imagination to ascertain what it's about. Or not. tbh their advice is sound and probably correct. You can lead a horse to water but you can't make him write better lyrics. Tech Notes Usual synth sounds and FX (see videos passim) plus a shout out to Arturia REV PLATE-140, UAD Pure Plate Reverb, UAD 1176 Compressor, Steinberg AutoFilter -- who all get an airing. Vocal synths from Brian &amp;amp; Sandra, Vocaloid. </description><thumbnail_url>https://nicovideo.cdn.nimg.jp/thumbnails/45266679/45266679.39932598</thumbnail_url><first_retrieve>2025-08-08T00:42:06+09:00</first_retrieve><length>2:39</length><movie_type>mp4</movie_type><size_high>1</size_high><size_low>1</size_low><view_counter>12</view_counter><comment_num>0</comment_num><mylist_counter>0</mylist_counter><last_res_body/><watch_url>https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm45266679</watch_url><thumb_type>video</thumb_type><embeddable>1</embeddable><no_live_play>0</no_live_play><tags domain="jp"/><genre>音楽・サウンド</genre><user_id>132645476</user_id><user_nickname>richaux</user_nickname><user_icon_url>https://secure-dcdn.cdn.nimg.jp/nicoaccount/usericon/13264/132645476.jpg?1744128402</user_icon_url></thumb></nicovideo_thumb_response>
