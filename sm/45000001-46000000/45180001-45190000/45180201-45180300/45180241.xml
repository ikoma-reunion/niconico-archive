This enables dynamic evaluation of morphological changes and injuries during joint motion.This technology is attracting attention in clinical research for assessing joint function and investigating the dynamic behavior of pathological conditions.#廣戸孝行</description><thumbnail_url>https://nicovideo.cdn.nimg.jp/thumbnails/45180241/45180241.89752620</thumbnail_url><first_retrieve>2025-07-12T19:52:04+09:00</first_retrieve><length>0:12</length><movie_type>mp4</movie_type><size_high>1</size_high><size_low>1</size_low><view_counter>2</view_counter><comment_num>0</comment_num><mylist_counter>0</mylist_counter><last_res_body/><watch_url>https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm45180241</watch_url><thumb_type>video</thumb_type><embeddable>1</embeddable><no_live_play>0</no_live_play><tags domain="jp"/><genre>未設定</genre><user_id>132960928</user_id><user_nickname>廣戸孝行</user_nickname><user_icon_url>https://secure-dcdn.cdn.nimg.jp/nicoaccount/usericon/defaults/blank.jpg</user_icon_url></thumb></nicovideo_thumb_response>
