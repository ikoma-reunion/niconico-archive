From here, he embarks on a journey that will span worlds and decide the fate of the entire kingdom.Battles are turn-based, but introduced to the series is the Active Time Battle (ATB) concept, which forces players to be quick with their decision-making because, despite the turn-based nature of the title, enemies can attack at brief intervals.The characters themselves are divided into classes and possess specific attributes and skills. Known as the "Easytype," the original US release excluded particular items, abilities, and spells, all of which have been restored for this release, dubbed "Hardtype." As part of the update, new FMV cutscenes are interjected throughout the game.</description><thumbnail_url>https://nicovideo.cdn.nimg.jp/thumbnails/45118040/45118040.92217895</thumbnail_url><first_retrieve>2025-06-24T09:25:03+09:00</first_retrieve><length>15:00</length><movie_type>mp4</movie_type><size_high>1</size_high><size_low>1</size_low><view_counter>3</view_counter><comment_num>0</comment_num><mylist_counter>0</mylist_counter><last_res_body/><watch_url>https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm45118040</watch_url><thumb_type>video</thumb_type><embeddable>1</embeddable><no_live_play>0</no_live_play><tags domain="jp"><tag lock="1">FinalFantasyⅣ</tag><tag lock="1">ファイナルファンタジーⅣ</tag><tag lock="1">PlayStation</tag><tag lock="1">PS1</tag><tag lock="1">プレイステーション</tag><tag lock="1">gameplay</tag></tags><genre>ゲーム</genre><user_id>123226612</user_id><user_nickname>The_VNS</user_nickname><user_icon_url>https://secure-dcdn.cdn.nimg.jp/nicoaccount/usericon/12322/123226612.jpg?1646346916</user_icon_url></thumb></nicovideo_thumb_response>
