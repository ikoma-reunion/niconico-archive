Known as “The Bravest Diver of the Depths.” (Probably because the others didn’t survive.)He doesn’t care about fame. He dives into boiling oceans chasing something called Azap Rubies — precious gems cooked inside the lungs of massive volcanic whales.His map is made of metal. His only friend is a guy named Haydar. And the last thing he left behind? A soggy note that said: “Gone deeper. I’ll return.”He might be a little crazy. But he’s our kind of crazy.This is just one of the many characters in our upcoming game Giant Hook. Would love to hear what you think. Do you also feel a weird emotional connection to grumpy underwater loners? 👀If you read this far, I owe you an Azap Ruby. Or at least a sea shanty.https://store.steampowered.com/app/3690550/OHAYO_GIANTHOOK_Monster_Fishing_Adventure/?l=finnish#GiantHook #indiegame #gamedev #deepsea #characterlore  #worldbuilding #azaprubies #underwatercore #oceanaesthetic #gamespoilers  #tumblrgames #pixelartgame #weirdfiction #marinelife #murg</description><thumbnail_url>https://nicovideo.cdn.nimg.jp/thumbnails/45123345/45123345.72948207</thumbnail_url><first_retrieve>2025-06-25T19:41:03+09:00</first_retrieve><length>0:15</length><movie_type>mp4</movie_type><size_high>1</size_high><size_low>1</size_low><view_counter>0</view_counter><comment_num>0</comment_num><mylist_counter>0</mylist_counter><last_res_body/><watch_url>https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm45123345</watch_url><thumb_type>video</thumb_type><embeddable>1</embeddable><no_live_play>0</no_live_play><tags domain="jp"/><genre>ゲーム</genre><user_id>139856138</user_id><user_nickname>gianthook!</user_nickname><user_icon_url>https://secure-dcdn.cdn.nimg.jp/nicoaccount/usericon/13985/139856138.jpg?1745843656</user_icon_url></thumb></nicovideo_thumb_response>
