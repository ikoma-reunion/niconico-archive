Using a deck of regular playing cards, players are tasked to score a minimum amount of chips each round with a limited amount of hands and discards. A complete run features 8 Antes, each with 3 blinds: the Small Blind, the Big Blind and a Boss Blind. Both Small and Big Blinds can be skipped if they opt to use a tag, with unique effects. Players can also improve their decks with Jokers, Tarot and Spectral cards, with unique effects. Planet cards can be used to upgrade a hand up a level. All of these as well as regular or enhanced playing cards can be bought in the shop after each round. Vouchers are also available there, with effects lasting for the rest of the run if bought. rythin ( https://tasvideos.org/Users/Profile/rythin) plays through the tutorial, winning a run on it in record time.</description><thumbnail_url>https://nicovideo.cdn.nimg.jp/thumbnails/44772703/44772703.26469131</thumbnail_url><first_retrieve>2025-03-17T15:18:04+09:00</first_retrieve><length>4:10</length><movie_type>mp4</movie_type><size_high>1</size_high><size_low>1</size_low><view_counter>348</view_counter><comment_num>2</comment_num><mylist_counter>2</mylist_counter><last_res_body>神ゲー うぽつ</last_res_body><watch_url>https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm44772703</watch_url><thumb_type>video</thumb_type><embeddable>1</embeddable><no_live_play>0</no_live_play><tags domain="jp"><tag lock="1">ゲーム</tag><tag lock="1">TAS</tag><tag lock="1">windows</tag><tag lock="1">バカラ</tag><tag>Balatro</tag></tags><genre>アニメ</genre><user_id>5776708</user_id><user_nickname>グローリア</user_nickname><user_icon_url>https://secure-dcdn.cdn.nimg.jp/nicoaccount/usericon/577/5776708.jpg?1517923487</user_icon_url></thumb></nicovideo_thumb_response>
