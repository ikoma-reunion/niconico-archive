It was released on November 16, 1995, and runs on a modified version of the Doom engine used in the Jaguar port. It features 28 levels from Ultimate Doom, 23 from Doom II and eight original levels.The game features a multiplayer mode, but lacks split-screen; two consoles have to be linked together instead.John Romero is quoted on the back cover, calling this the "best DOOM yet," and is credited as "Creator of DOOM". While Romero's quote may be taken with a grain of salt, former id Software staff have consistently expressed how pleased they were with the job performed by the Williams team in performing the conversion. They were originally selected by id Software due to their renown in the arcade market and their acquisition of Tradewest, a company with extensive game console development experience.</description><thumbnail_url>https://nicovideo.cdn.nimg.jp/thumbnails/45095987/45095987.2341264</thumbnail_url><first_retrieve>2025-06-17T23:03:04+09:00</first_retrieve><length>15:00</length><movie_type>mp4</movie_type><size_high>1</size_high><size_low>1</size_low><view_counter>3</view_counter><comment_num>0</comment_num><mylist_counter>0</mylist_counter><last_res_body/><watch_url>https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm45095987</watch_url><thumb_type>video</thumb_type><embeddable>1</embeddable><no_live_play>0</no_live_play><tags domain="jp"><tag lock="1">Doom</tag><tag lock="1">ドゥーム</tag><tag lock="1">PlayStation</tag><tag lock="1">PS1</tag><tag lock="1">プレイステーション</tag><tag lock="1">gameplay</tag></tags><genre>ゲーム</genre><user_id>123226612</user_id><user_nickname>The_VNS</user_nickname><user_icon_url>https://secure-dcdn.cdn.nimg.jp/nicoaccount/usericon/12322/123226612.jpg?1646346916</user_icon_url></thumb></nicovideo_thumb_response>
