It depicts the tedious and tiring life of someone who works a draining job under capitalism and is approaching burnout. In the end, they reach their limit and decide to reject the corrupt society which exploits their labor and steals their life away. Capitalism forces us to spend the majority of our lives working jobs that we hate just to survive, while the ruling class pockets the fruits of our labor. It’s ridiculous we have to give so much of our lives over to them and get nothing in return. We need to end this society and create a new one in which the masses control the means of production, and the main motive is to meet people’s needs rather than to make profit. We must actually reap the benefits of our labor and have humane working conditions!</description><thumbnail_url>https://nicovideo.cdn.nimg.jp/thumbnails/45305648/45305648.30786012</thumbnail_url><first_retrieve>2025-08-19T00:52:04+09:00</first_retrieve><length>2:40</length><movie_type>mp4</movie_type><size_high>1</size_high><size_low>1</size_low><view_counter>1</view_counter><comment_num>0</comment_num><mylist_counter>0</mylist_counter><last_res_body/><watch_url>https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm45305648</watch_url><thumb_type>video</thumb_type><embeddable>1</embeddable><no_live_play>0</no_live_play><tags domain="jp"/><genre>音楽・サウンド</genre><user_id>140423223</user_id><user_nickname>Flam Chowder</user_nickname><user_icon_url>https://secure-dcdn.cdn.nimg.jp/nicoaccount/usericon/14042/140423223.jpg?1749355469</user_icon_url></thumb></nicovideo_thumb_response>
