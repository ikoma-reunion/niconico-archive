The game was released in the United States and Europe as Mobile Light Force for the PlayStation.Gunbird uses anime-styled character as the player's chosen craft. A story plays out in between levels and before boss fights, telling a tale of how the protagonists are trying to collect pieces of a magic mirror to make a wish.Each character in Gunbird has three attacks: A normal shot, a charge shot, and a bomb that clears the screen of enemies and bullets. The normal shot can be strengthened by grabbing power-ups and extra bombs can be collected. Coins, which are found by destroying certain buildings or enemies, can be collected for bonus points.This is the first Psikyo game to feature a special power-down system, one that would be used in every Psikyo shooter afterward.</description><thumbnail_url>https://nicovideo.cdn.nimg.jp/thumbnails/45188217/45188217.55772644</thumbnail_url><first_retrieve>2025-07-15T05:50:03+09:00</first_retrieve><length>15:00</length><movie_type>mp4</movie_type><size_high>1</size_high><size_low>1</size_low><view_counter>0</view_counter><comment_num>0</comment_num><mylist_counter>0</mylist_counter><last_res_body/><watch_url>https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm45188217</watch_url><thumb_type>video</thumb_type><embeddable>1</embeddable><no_live_play>0</no_live_play><tags domain="jp"><tag lock="1">Gunbird</tag><tag lock="1">ガンバード</tag><tag lock="1">PlayStation</tag><tag lock="1">PS1</tag><tag lock="1">プレイステーション</tag><tag lock="1">gameplay</tag></tags><genre>ゲーム</genre><user_id>123226612</user_id><user_nickname>The_VNS</user_nickname><user_icon_url>https://secure-dcdn.cdn.nimg.jp/nicoaccount/usericon/12322/123226612.jpg?1646346916</user_icon_url></thumb></nicovideo_thumb_response>
