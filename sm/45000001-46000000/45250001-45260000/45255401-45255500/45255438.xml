I really like this song, so I finally made up my mind to finish it. The guitar arrangement is done, though my playing feels clumsy and lacking. The bass line is also quite simple. But you know, I’m genuinely happy—it feels like I’ve taken a real step forward. If I ever get the chance to be in a band again in the future, I’ll definitely, definitely perform this song!</description><thumbnail_url>https://nicovideo.cdn.nimg.jp/thumbnails/45255438/45255438.23988978</thumbnail_url><first_retrieve>2025-08-04T12:50:03+09:00</first_retrieve><length>4:37</length><movie_type>mp4</movie_type><size_high>1</size_high><size_low>1</size_low><view_counter>3</view_counter><comment_num>0</comment_num><mylist_counter>0</mylist_counter><last_res_body/><watch_url>https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm45255438</watch_url><thumb_type>video</thumb_type><embeddable>1</embeddable><no_live_play>0</no_live_play><tags domain="jp"/><genre>未設定</genre><user_id>139832631</user_id><user_nickname>Xilin</user_nickname><user_icon_url>https://secure-dcdn.cdn.nimg.jp/nicoaccount/usericon/13983/139832631.jpg?1745721982</user_icon_url></thumb></nicovideo_thumb_response>
