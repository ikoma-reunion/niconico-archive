It's true that a person has to accept themselves as they are. I see many people who are never satisfied with their appearance, even after having several plastic surgeries, and many die in the name of aesthetic beauty. I believe that body part surgery is rare, because I observe that most people are completely normal when it comes to their physical appearance. In most cases, a person does it to beautify themselves. There are people who sink into hidden debts because of excessive vanity. I believe that it is even a form of selfishness when you use your money for aesthetic reasons. You are afraid of taking the COVID vaccine thinking that you will have a heart attack, but you take the vaccine to get Botox without fear, even knowing that many people die, you hypocrite!bandido bom é bandido mortoaxpiorrackgeração raiz covarde e imunda viva a geração nutellalentamente um guisado para escapar de lento</description><thumbnail_url>https://nicovideo.cdn.nimg.jp/thumbnails/44766592/44766592.17839846</thumbnail_url><first_retrieve>2025-03-15T23:43:03+09:00</first_retrieve><length>0:31</length><movie_type>mp4</movie_type><size_high>1</size_high><size_low>1</size_low><view_counter>5</view_counter><comment_num>0</comment_num><mylist_counter>0</mylist_counter><last_res_body/><watch_url>https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm44766592</watch_url><thumb_type>video</thumb_type><embeddable>1</embeddable><no_live_play>0</no_live_play><tags domain="jp"/><genre>未設定</genre></thumb></nicovideo_thumb_response>
