Entering the game as a rookie in an illegal street race, London Racer allows the player to build their skill and finally drive a GT car around a selection of London tracks.Three race types are included: Quick Race for single players to chase on a track of their choice, Time Trail to challenge real speed freaks and Tournament, a rip-roaring race against opponents within 3 leagues. The battle includes aggressive drivers, police chases and road rage rivals who will push the player off the road! Accelerate up to earn more money that enables the purchase of valuable extras for the car (though not Go Faster Stripes!) And when qualified, the pace is set for the Super League.</description><thumbnail_url>https://nicovideo.cdn.nimg.jp/thumbnails/45205276/45205276.2412035</thumbnail_url><first_retrieve>2025-07-20T23:28:03+09:00</first_retrieve><length>15:00</length><movie_type>mp4</movie_type><size_high>1</size_high><size_low>1</size_low><view_counter>2</view_counter><comment_num>0</comment_num><mylist_counter>0</mylist_counter><last_res_body/><watch_url>https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm45205276</watch_url><thumb_type>video</thumb_type><embeddable>1</embeddable><no_live_play>0</no_live_play><tags domain="jp"><tag lock="1">LondonRacer</tag><tag lock="1">M25Racer</tag><tag lock="1">PlayStation</tag><tag lock="1">PS1</tag><tag lock="1">プレイステーション</tag><tag lock="1">gameplay</tag></tags><genre>ゲーム</genre><user_id>123226612</user_id><user_nickname>The_VNS</user_nickname><user_icon_url>https://secure-dcdn.cdn.nimg.jp/nicoaccount/usericon/12322/123226612.jpg?1646346916</user_icon_url></thumb></nicovideo_thumb_response>
