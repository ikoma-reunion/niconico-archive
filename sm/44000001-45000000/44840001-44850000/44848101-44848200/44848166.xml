The idea was to overdose on a song I liked, so that the song's structure or ambience or intent would then seep -- osmosis style -- into my next creation. I'm not sure it has but I like the process.Anyway, this track is about being true to yourself; being comfortable with your dubious decisions.Technically, the drum sounds are from Groove Agent with some added Backbone sourced hi-hats. The various brass instruments are from NN-XT samples. Other synths from Thor and filtered, sampled sawtooth waves (NN19), stock Cubase Retrologue, Halion, Padshop in there too. Vocals are from the Vocaloid6 set -- hello, Allen and Sandra; their formant glitchiness tempered by EQ &amp;amp; saturation. ¹ youtu.be/GSrGvjTuNRI</description><thumbnail_url>https://nicovideo.cdn.nimg.jp/thumbnails/44848166/44848166.40357944</thumbnail_url><first_retrieve>2025-04-09T01:05:03+09:00</first_retrieve><length>3:48</length><movie_type>mp4</movie_type><size_high>1</size_high><size_low>1</size_low><view_counter>37</view_counter><comment_num>0</comment_num><mylist_counter>1</mylist_counter><last_res_body/><watch_url>https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm44848166</watch_url><thumb_type>video</thumb_type><embeddable>1</embeddable><no_live_play>0</no_live_play><tags domain="jp"><tag>VOCALOID</tag></tags><genre>音楽・サウンド</genre><user_id>132645476</user_id><user_nickname>richaux</user_nickname><user_icon_url>https://secure-dcdn.cdn.nimg.jp/nicoaccount/usericon/13264/132645476.jpg?1744128402</user_icon_url></thumb></nicovideo_thumb_response>
