Mr. Rothko took exception to his original commission -- the creations were to be displayed in the restaurant in the Seagram Building -- deciding that the paintings should not be presented as a backdrop to rich folk chomping on their dinner. [Citation required!] This song tries to embrace that theme -- it has a edgier, industrial tone to try and capture the angst. Sorry, Mark. Tech Notes Drums are from Groove Agent and Backbone. Bass sounds from Reason. Synths and gurgles from Halion, Arturia CS80, the wonderfully grainy "Bloom Vocal Aether", Full Bucket's NY and Oxid. Vocal synths are courtesy of Vocaloid 6's Hayato, a relatively new kid on the block.</description><thumbnail_url>https://nicovideo.cdn.nimg.jp/thumbnails/45161266/45161266.20010308</thumbnail_url><first_retrieve>2025-07-06T22:44:03+09:00</first_retrieve><length>1:45</length><movie_type>mp4</movie_type><size_high>1</size_high><size_low>1</size_low><view_counter>6</view_counter><comment_num>0</comment_num><mylist_counter>0</mylist_counter><last_res_body/><watch_url>https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm45161266</watch_url><thumb_type>video</thumb_type><embeddable>1</embeddable><no_live_play>0</no_live_play><tags domain="jp"/><genre>音楽・サウンド</genre><user_id>132645476</user_id><user_nickname>richaux</user_nickname><user_icon_url>https://secure-dcdn.cdn.nimg.jp/nicoaccount/usericon/13264/132645476.jpg?1744128402</user_icon_url></thumb></nicovideo_thumb_response>
