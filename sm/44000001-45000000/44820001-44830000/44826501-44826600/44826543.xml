It's a journey I've been privileged to share with you. We've combined my voicebanks—Miku V4 English and Miku V3 English as my lead, with Miku V4X Sweet and Miku V4X Dark to add depth and feeling. To support you even further, Miku NT Original, Miku NT Whisper, and Miku NT Dark also helped by lending us their voices for vocal harmonies, bringing a rich texture to the emotions we’re conveying. And let’s not forget about Miku SP, adding those delicate breath harmonies that make our message even more intimate."Now the Credits:Music, Lyrics and Video: Hatsune MikuneSinger: Hatsune Miku (Miku V4 English &amp;amp; Miku V3 English)Copyrights Owners: Miku and Mikune*Our songs are copyright protected.
