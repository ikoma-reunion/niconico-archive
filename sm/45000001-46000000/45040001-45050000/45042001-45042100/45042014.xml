Don’t you think I know that? Keeping bits of moonstone next to me Tried to shave your stubble but you gashed your cheek won’t you stay away Won’t you stay away from me with you I’m always Making rainbows out of something painful Getting fried as hell n dodging gravestones You look like me when you lie Boiled blood star shifts in the window of my eye You put warm salt to the stitch and I suffer for the sky that you shook 9 times You smell like burnt hibiscus I still feel blessed even when you’re bitching You stole my spine for a minute so I cut my hair just to make you smile Making rainbows out of something painful Getting fried as hell n dodging gravestones</description><thumbnail_url>https://nicovideo.cdn.nimg.jp/thumbnails/45042014/45042014.15933855</thumbnail_url><first_retrieve>2025-06-01T01:07:03+09:00</first_retrieve><length>2:52</length><movie_type>mp4</movie_type><size_high>1</size_high><size_low>1</size_low><view_counter>65</view_counter><comment_num>0</comment_num><mylist_counter>1</mylist_counter><last_res_body/><watch_url>https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm45042014</watch_url><thumb_type>video</thumb_type><embeddable>1</embeddable><no_live_play>0</no_live_play><tags domain="jp"><tag lock="1">洋楽</tag><tag lock="1">Arlo_Parks</tag><tag lock="1">Lapwing</tag></tags><genre>音楽・サウンド</genre><user_id>123019967</user_id><user_nickname>タピオカ</user_nickname><user_icon_url>https://secure-dcdn.cdn.nimg.jp/nicoaccount/usericon/12301/123019967.jpg?1723729818</user_icon_url></thumb></nicovideo_thumb_response>
