Gameplay is much more plot-driven, as you have middle-bosses that can change depending on what team you select. In addition, there are several special endings which are only shown when certain "Edit Team" combinations are selected.As of The King of Fighters '97, you can play in either the Extra or Advanced game modes. Extra Mode is the typical AOF/KOF scheme, in which your power gauge fills up as you defend yourself or charge yourself up. The new Advanced Mode, only allows you to charge your gauge as you perform special moves and attacks. Extra allows one to sidestep attacks while Advanced allows the character to roll and dodge attacks; Advanced also allow a character to perform a potent "Super Desperation Move" at any time. In contrast, SDMs can only be performed in Extra when a character has less than a quarter of their health left.</description><thumbnail_url>https://nicovideo.cdn.nimg.jp/thumbnails/45329819/45329819.61624458</thumbnail_url><first_retrieve>2025-08-24T10:37:03+09:00</first_retrieve><length>15:00</length><movie_type>mp4</movie_type><size_high>1</size_high><size_low>1</size_low><view_counter>3</view_counter><comment_num>0</comment_num><mylist_counter>0</mylist_counter><last_res_body/><watch_url>https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm45329819</watch_url><thumb_type>video</thumb_type><embeddable>1</embeddable><no_live_play>0</no_live_play><tags domain="jp"><tag lock="1">KOF97</tag><tag lock="1">ザ・キング・オブ・ファイターズ'97</tag><tag lock="1">PlayStation</tag><tag lock="1">PS1</tag><tag lock="1">プレイステーション</tag><tag lock="1">gameplay</tag></tags><genre>ゲーム</genre><user_id>123226612</user_id><user_nickname>The_VNS</user_nickname><user_icon_url>https://secure-dcdn.cdn.nimg.jp/nicoaccount/usericon/12322/123226612.jpg?1646346916</user_icon_url></thumb></nicovideo_thumb_response>
