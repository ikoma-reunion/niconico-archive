I believe in your soul every day,Trust in you makes me whole,long dayswe should run away from that place,To a new world where we're going to chase.  Even in darkest, lonely days,I'll be here, gently soothe your ways,Let your tears softly fall, it's fine,I'll hold you close, ease your weary mind.  All the plain sights we gladly see,You and me, we're forever just free,Simple views are always shining the best,Let's move on now, find our rest.  When the hard times relentlessly cease,Choose to live, seek your inner peace,I'll be here, always by your side,Love your heart, it's my endless pride.  Just to live every vibrant day,Just to walk in your chosen way,That's enough, you're incredibly strong,We'll keep going, together along.  Ordinary, that's simply us,Daily life, with no needless fuss,Simple love song we joyfully sing,Hold them close, let them brightly ring.</description><thumbnail_url>https://nicovideo.cdn.nimg.jp/thumbnails/45101175/45101175.92502808</thumbnail_url><first_retrieve>2025-06-19T00:47:03+09:00</first_retrieve><length>2:58</length><movie_type>mp4</movie_type><size_high>1</size_high><size_low>1</size_low><view_counter>58</view_counter><comment_num>1</comment_num><mylist_counter>0</mylist_counter><last_res_body>うぽつです</last_res_body><watch_url>https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm45101175</watch_url><thumb_type>video</thumb_type><embeddable>1</embeddable><no_live_play>0</no_live_play><tags domain="jp"><tag lock="1">VOCALOID</tag><tag lock="1">english_version</tag><tag lock="1">花響琴</tag><tag lock="1">花響琴オリジナル曲</tag><tag lock="1">vocaloidオリジナル曲</tag></tags><genre>音楽・サウンド</genre><user_id>140069434</user_id><user_nickname>Seizy@フィジカリス137</user_nickname><user_icon_url>https://secure-dcdn.cdn.nimg.jp/nicoaccount/usericon/14006/140069434.jpg?1747193012</user_icon_url></thumb></nicovideo_thumb_response>
