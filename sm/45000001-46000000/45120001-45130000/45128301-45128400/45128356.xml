I can't speak Japanese yet, but I'm doing my best. I'm going to buy a box of Pockies today and eat them while thinking about how important they are to me. I know pronunciation is difficult for everyone, so I thought I'd give you some time to teach you how to pronounce it so that you can speak English better. Isn't that great? I love them all!I apologize if this translation is rough. I don't know Japanese yet, but I am working on it. Today, I thought I would buy a box of Pocky, to enjoy while I think about how much you guys mean to me. I know pronunciations are difficult for everyone, so I thought I would spend the time to deliver pronunciations so that you can speak better English. Pretty cool, huh? Love you guys!</description><thumbnail_url>https://nicovideo.cdn.nimg.jp/thumbnails/45128356/45128356.11342320</thumbnail_url><first_retrieve>2025-06-27T15:14:04+09:00</first_retrieve><length>36:18</length><movie_type>mp4</movie_type><size_high>1</size_high><size_low>1</size_low><view_counter>4</view_counter><comment_num>0</comment_num><mylist_counter>0</mylist_counter><last_res_body/><watch_url>https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm45128356</watch_url><thumb_type>video</thumb_type><embeddable>1</embeddable><no_live_play>0</no_live_play><tags domain="jp"/><genre>その他</genre><user_id>140588764</user_id><user_nickname>IamVM6</user_nickname><user_icon_url>https://secure-dcdn.cdn.nimg.jp/nicoaccount/usericon/14058/140588764.jpg?1750485847</user_icon_url></thumb></nicovideo_thumb_response>
