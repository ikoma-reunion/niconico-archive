The game was ported to the Dreamcast in 2000 and released worldwide.Seven warriors are challenged to head on a quest to find three powerful elements of Sun, Moon and Stars. Whoever brings the elements to the Potion God will be rewarded the legendary Almighty Potion and all its magical powers.Through gameplay cutscenes it appears that the zany, uproarious humor has considerably increased since the original Gunbird. The game has numerous similarities to the Parodius series, including the final boss in the game, a cartoon elephant playing a trumpet.There are seven stages in each game loop. The first three stages are randomly chosen from possible four. At the second loop, enemies fire denser bullet patterns moving at faster speeds.</description><thumbnail_url>https://nicovideo.cdn.nimg.jp/thumbnails/44829494/44829494.22977757</thumbnail_url><first_retrieve>2025-04-01T13:18:03+09:00</first_retrieve><length>14:59</length><movie_type>mp4</movie_type><size_high>1</size_high><size_low>1</size_low><view_counter>1</view_counter><comment_num>0</comment_num><mylist_counter>0</mylist_counter><last_res_body/><watch_url>https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm44829494</watch_url><thumb_type>video</thumb_type><embeddable>1</embeddable><no_live_play>0</no_live_play><tags domain="jp"><tag lock="1">Gunbird2</tag><tag lock="1">ガンバード2</tag><tag lock="1">Dreamcast</tag><tag lock="1">ドリームキャスト</tag><tag lock="1">DC</tag><tag lock="1">gameplay</tag></tags><genre>ゲーム</genre><user_id>123226612</user_id><user_nickname>The_VNS</user_nickname><user_icon_url>https://secure-dcdn.cdn.nimg.jp/nicoaccount/usericon/12322/123226612.jpg?1646346916</user_icon_url></thumb></nicovideo_thumb_response>
