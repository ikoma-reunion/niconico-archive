Soon, there was peace, but an organization of military officers from all over the world form an army known as CANY. Their mission is to conquer the world with weapons never seen before from rockets to mechanical walkers. The world quickly formed a group of pilots and planes called the Strikers whose mission is to rid CANY from the world.Each plane in Strikers 1945 has three attacks: A normal shot, a charged shot, and a bomb that clears the screen. Both the normal shot and the charged shot can be strengthened by grabbing power-ups and extra bombs can be collected. In Japan, Strikers 1945 was ported to both PlayStation and Sega Saturn in 1996 by Atlus and later ported to PlayStation 2 as part of Psikyo Shooting Collection Vol. 1: Strikers 1945 I &amp;amp; II by Taito.</description><thumbnail_url>https://nicovideo.cdn.nimg.jp/thumbnails/45310217/45310217.39817167</thumbnail_url><first_retrieve>2025-08-21T00:04:03+09:00</first_retrieve><length>15:00</length><movie_type>mp4</movie_type><size_high>1</size_high><size_low>1</size_low><view_counter>1</view_counter><comment_num>0</comment_num><mylist_counter>0</mylist_counter><last_res_body/><watch_url>https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm45310217</watch_url><thumb_type>video</thumb_type><embeddable>1</embeddable><no_live_play>0</no_live_play><tags domain="jp"><tag lock="1">STRIKERS1945</tag><tag lock="1">ストライカーズ1945</tag><tag lock="1">PlayStation</tag><tag lock="1">PS1</tag><tag lock="1">プレイステーション</tag><tag lock="1">gameplay</tag></tags><genre>ゲーム</genre><user_id>123226612</user_id><user_nickname>The_VNS</user_nickname><user_icon_url>https://secure-dcdn.cdn.nimg.jp/nicoaccount/usericon/12322/123226612.jpg?1646346916</user_icon_url></thumb></nicovideo_thumb_response>
