And they shall know, understand, and realize that I the Lord have spoken in My zeal, when I have accomplished My wrath upon them. [Ezek 36:6; 38:19.] 14 Moreover, I will make you a desolation and a reproach among the nations that are round about you and in the sight of all who pass by. [Lev 26:31,32; Neh 2:17.] 15 So it shall be a reproach and a taunt, a warning and a horror and an astonishment to the [heathen] nations around you when I shall execute judgments upon you in anger and in wrath and in furious chastisements and rebukes — I the Lord have spoken it. [Deut 28:37; Ps 79:4; Jer 24:9.] 16 When I shall loose against them the evil arrows of hunger that are for destruction, which I will send to destroy you, then I will increase the famine upon you and will break your staff of bread.
