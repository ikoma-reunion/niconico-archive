The gameplay is mission based and involves elements of strategy and planning. The player can order wingmen to fly in formation and attack specific targets.Star Fighter 3000 was first released for the Acorn Archimedes, in November 1994, by Tim Parry and Andrew Hutching.The 3DO version was developed after the original Acorn version was released. The map screen is in 3D, not 2D as in the Acorn RISC OS version. Also, to upgrade the ship the player must collect a series of 3D shapes after blowing up certain objects. Another difference is that the player can blast pathways through mountain ranges with the laser.Star Fighter 3000 was also released for the PC, Sony PlayStation and Sega Saturn by Acclaim Entertainment. These versions were ports of the 3DO version. Unlike the original and 3DO version, Tim Parry and Andrew Hutchings had no involvement.</description><thumbnail_url>https://nicovideo.cdn.nimg.jp/thumbnails/45306419/45306419.57581624</thumbnail_url><first_retrieve>2025-08-19T23:35:04+09:00</first_retrieve><length>15:00</length><movie_type>mp4</movie_type><size_high>1</size_high><size_low>1</size_low><view_counter>0</view_counter><comment_num>0</comment_num><mylist_counter>0</mylist_counter><last_res_body/><watch_url>https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm45306419</watch_url><thumb_type>video</thumb_type><embeddable>1</embeddable><no_live_play>0</no_live_play><tags domain="jp"><tag lock="1">StarFighter</tag><tag lock="1">スターファイター</tag><tag lock="1">PlayStation</tag><tag lock="1">PS1</tag><tag lock="1">プレイステーション</tag><tag lock="1">gameplay</tag></tags><genre>ゲーム</genre><user_id>123226612</user_id><user_nickname>The_VNS</user_nickname><user_icon_url>https://secure-dcdn.cdn.nimg.jp/nicoaccount/usericon/12322/123226612.jpg?1646346916</user_icon_url></thumb></nicovideo_thumb_response>
