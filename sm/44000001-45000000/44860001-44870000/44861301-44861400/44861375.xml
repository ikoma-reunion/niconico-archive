Vocals from Vocaloid's Taku and Jessica ... with a smidgen of step-filter.Tech Notes‚ö† Warning: do not operate heavy machinery whilst readingThe retro simulator VSTs are from fullbucket.de -- they've been nicely stable within Cubase (I'm a bit precious about polluting the DAW with rogue plug-ins).A Paralogy emulator mimics a Crumar Trilogy in the intro; the sweep sound is the Ny simulator (Korg Lambda); A Korg DW-8000 emulator (FB-7999) fills in the chorus bass line. There's a Reason synth bass (Europa), and UAD bass (PolyMax) in there too. The bass components are largely side-chained from the drums to keep them under some semblance of control.The resonant sweep melody is from Reason's Thor; pads from PolyMax and Cubase's Padshop. And Retrologue.I had hoped to use the Drumtraqs emulator (also fullbucket.de) ... but they didn't settle ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ... so swapped for Backbone soundset (and "impact" noises from there too).</description><thumbnail_url>https://nicovideo.cdn.nimg.jp/thumbnails/44861375/44861375.70256306</thumbnail_url><first_retrieve>2025-04-10T22:29:04+09:00</first_retrieve><length>3:40</length><movie_type>mp4</movie_type><size_high>1</size_high><size_low>1</size_low><view_counter>28</view_counter><comment_num>0</comment_num><mylist_counter>0</mylist_counter><last_res_body/><watch_url>https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm44861375</watch_url><thumb_type>video</thumb_type><embeddable>1</embeddable><no_live_play>0</no_live_play><tags domain="jp"><tag>VOCALOID</tag></tags><genre>Èü≥Ê•Ω„Éª„Çµ„Ç¶„É≥„Éâ</genre><user_id>132645476</user_id><user_nickname>richaux</user_nickname><user_icon_url>https://secure-dcdn.cdn.nimg.jp/nicoaccount/usericon/13264/132645476.jpg?1744128402</user_icon_url></thumb></nicovideo_thumb_response>
