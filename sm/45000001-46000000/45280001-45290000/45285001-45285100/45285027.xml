The company behind Half-Life, Portal, Counter-Strike, Team Fortress, Left 4 Dead, DOTA 2 and much more. Featuring: ELLEN MCLAIN, the official GLaDOS from “Portal” and "Portal 2" as GLaDOS! THE STUPENDIUM, the amazing nerdcore artist, as Gabe Newell! And finally, Valve’s CEO, GABE NEWELL himself, who sang a couple of lines for the beginning and the end of the song!
