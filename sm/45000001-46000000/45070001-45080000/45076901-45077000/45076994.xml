During the Millennial Fair, Crono meets and quickly befriends a woman named Marle. While visiting Crono's inventor friend Lucca, Marle is inadvertently sent into the past and Crono and Lucca must set off after her. Dubbed the "Tech System," the game allows characters to combine elemental attacks in order to produce Double and even Triple Techs.Copied from MobyGames:The PlayStation version features an anime-style introduction movie and cutscenes, a "movie theater" mode which allows the player to re-watch these movies and listen to the game's songs, as well as an unlockable bestiary, dungeon maps, and art gallery. The Nintendo DS version retains these changes and adds two new dungeons and a new possible ending that foreshadows the events of Chrono Cross.</description><thumbnail_url>https://nicovideo.cdn.nimg.jp/thumbnails/45076994/45076994.73706710</thumbnail_url><first_retrieve>2025-06-11T21:36:04+09:00</first_retrieve><length>15:00</length><movie_type>mp4</movie_type><size_high>1</size_high><size_low>1</size_low><view_counter>1</view_counter><comment_num>0</comment_num><mylist_counter>0</mylist_counter><last_res_body/><watch_url>https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm45076994</watch_url><thumb_type>video</thumb_type><embeddable>1</embeddable><no_live_play>0</no_live_play><tags domain="jp"><tag lock="1">Chrono_Trigger</tag><tag lock="1">クロノトリガー</tag><tag lock="1">PlayStation</tag><tag lock="1">PS1</tag><tag lock="1">プレイステーション</tag><tag lock="1">gameplay</tag></tags><genre>ゲーム</genre><user_id>123226612</user_id><user_nickname>The_VNS</user_nickname><user_icon_url>https://secure-dcdn.cdn.nimg.jp/nicoaccount/usericon/12322/123226612.jpg?1646346916</user_icon_url></thumb></nicovideo_thumb_response>
