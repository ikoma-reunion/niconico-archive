[Ps 104:30; Heb 1:2; 11:3.] 27 So God created man in His own image, in the image and likeness of God He created him; male and female He created them. [Col 3:9,10; James 3:8,9.] 28 And God blessed them and said to them, Be fruitful, multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it [using all its vast resources in the service of God and man]; and have dominion over the fish of the sea, the birds of the air, and over every living creature that moves upon the earth. 29 And God said, See, I have given you every plant yielding seed that is on the face of all the land and every tree with seed in its fruit; you shall have them for food.
